The "Dynamic Array Program" GitHub repository is a collection of source code and related files that implements a dynamic array data structure in a programming language. A dynamic array is a type of array data structure that can be resized during program execution, allowing for more flexible memory management compared to traditional static arrays.

This repository provides an implementation of a dynamic array that includes features such as adding, removing, and accessing elements, resizing the array, and retrieving the size of the array. The code is designed to be easily understandable and modifiable, making it a useful resource for anyone looking to learn about dynamic arrays or modify the implementation for their own use.
